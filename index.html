      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Rudi, an 18-year-old professional Actor and Voice Actor based in Blackpool, Lancashire. I have a year of experience in acting and voice work, with a versatile style that ranges from vibrant and energetic to dark and gritty. I strive to bring every character to life with emotion and depth, using both my voice and physicality to craft compelling performances.</p>
      <p>I'm currently studying Theatre and Performance Practice at the University of Salford, developing skills in acting, directing, devising, and stagecraft. I also regularly train at The Actors Workroom, refining my technique through script reading, stage performance, and collaborative sessions.</p>
