      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Rudi, a professional Actor and Voice Actor based in the UK. I bring dynamic characters to life with emotional nuance and vocal versatility. My work spans narration, commercial VO, and character acting for games and short films.</p>
      <p>I take pride in my work and am open to playing a wide range of roles. My style ranges from expressive and energetic to dark and grounded. I’ve trained to make my performance more genuine through physical and vocal technique.</p>
